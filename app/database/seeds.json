        "definition" : "A seafreight forwarder or a Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) is a company who specialises in organising sea shipments for individuals or businesses to move goods from one country to another country.  Multiple small shipments to the same destination are consolidated and shipped in the same container to the destination port where they are deconsolidated for collection or final delivery to the consignee.   To support the freight forwarding business, the freight forwarder has to coordinate with multiple parties to execute a shipment. These include some of the following:\n\na. Forwarders often have established contracts to work with one or multiple carriers to move the goods where they secured discounted rates on container shipments.\n\nb. They have to secure shipments and plan the loading of goods into each container which is typically carried out in a container freight station that is residing within or outside the port area.\n\nc. They need to work with transporters / shippers to coordinate the collection /delivery of the goods.  \n\nd. They have to work with Government Agencies for customs clearance.  \n\ne. They have to work with the port authority to transport the container into the port for loading unto ships.  \n\nf. They have to work with overseas agents and partners to receive the container and deconsolidate for consignee’s collection or arrange delivery to consignee.  \n\nOn a daily basis, the focus is on the execution of the shipments to meet the customers’ requirements.  At the operational level, the objective is to organise the work flow and improve the coordination so that profits can be maximised without compromising customers’ requirements.   At the strategic level, the focus is to build overseas agencies network where the business can grow.",

A mini-landbridge service taps on the railway network that spans the USA from coast to coast connecting major ports on east coast to west coast.

Other costs include terminal handling charges, marine insurance cost, packing and palletisation cost, customs clearance, documentation cost, bunker adjustment factor, currency adjustment factor and any other destination charges.  To the shippers, these cost can be quoted as an all-in ocean freight rate or as separate components.    Typically, freight forwarders consolidate small shipments from many customers and ship as a full container to the destination port where they are de-consolidate for delivery to the consignees.  As such, freight forwarders will try to maximise the number of LCL shipments into a single container so that freight revenue per container can be maximised.  The profit to freight forwarder is the difference between the revenue received per container and the discounted FCL container rate that they obtained with ocean carriers.",

The unit or standard cost is required because it forms the basis for the warehouse to determine the price to charge a service offered to customers.    Second, a warehouse must know which elements are the key cost drivers and direct efforts at reducing these cost drivers.   Third, managing cost requires the warehouse to know how to develop a budget from which monitoring can be made between actual performance and budgeted performance.  \n\nLocation analysis techniques are qualitative approach to help in deciding the best location for a warehouse.
